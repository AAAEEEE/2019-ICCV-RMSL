## Paper
* We propose a method to hierarchically identify the underlying cluster structure of high-dimensional data by constructing reciprocal multi-layer subspace representations.
* Based on reconstruction, we learn the latent representation by enforcing it to be close to different view-specific subspace representations, which implicitly co-regularizes subspace structures of all views to be consistent to each other.
* With the introduction of neural networks, more general relationships among different views will be explored.
